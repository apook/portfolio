			  Our car comes with a jack so you can change one tire at a time,<br/>

			  set of jack stands.<br/>

					<strong>Use the wrench to loosen the lug nuts.</strong>
					You may need to remove the hubcap. Don't remove the lug nuts at 
					this point; simply loosen them by turning the wrench to the left 
					(counter-clockwise). If the lug nuts are really tight, try placing 
					the wrench on the nut and standing on the wrench arm to use your full 
					weight on it. You can also try hitting the wrench arm with a rock.
				</li>
				
				<li id="RefIIii">
					<strong>Use the jack to lift the vehicle off the ground.</strong> 
					Different car models may have different places to put the jack; consult 
					your owner's manual for specific locations. Once the jack is securely 
					in the correct spot, jack up the car until the tire is about 6 inches 
					off the ground.
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div id="Ref_III">Step III: Removing the tire</div>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Remove the lug nuts and pull the tire off the car.</strong> 
				  Make sure to place the lug nuts in a pile that won't get scattered, and 
				  pull the tire straight toward yourself to remove it from the wheel base.
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div id="RefIV">Step IV: Replacing the tire</div>
			<ol type="a" class="sublist">
				<li id="RefIVi">
				<strong>Place the spare on the car.</strong> Line up the lug nut posts 
				with the holes in the spare, and push the spare all the way onto the 
				wheel base until it can't go any farther.
				</li>

				
				<li id="RefIVii">
				<strong>Put on the lug nuts.</strong> Don't put them on tightly, just 
				make sure they're on enough for the spare to stay on the car for a moment.
				</li>

				<li id="RefIViii">
				<strong>Lower the car back to the ground.</strong> Use the jack to bring 
				the car back down to ground level. Remove the jack from underneath the car.
				</li>
			  
				<li id="RefIViv">
				<strong>Make sure the lug nuts are tightened.</strong> With the car back 
				on the ground, you can now tighten the lug nuts. Rather than tightening 
				them one by one in order, start with one lug nut, tighten it about 50%, 
				move to the opposite nut (across the circle) and tighten that one about 
				the same amount. Keep tightening opposite lug nuts gradually in turn 
				until each lug nut is as tight as it can be.
				</li>
			
				<li id="RefIVv">
					<strong>Put your flat tire and tools back in your trunk.</strong> Make 
					sure you don't leave anything on the side of the road.
