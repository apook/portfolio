			As with San Francisco, you can visit the rest of the Bay Area comfortably at any time of year,
			and it's especially nice in late spring and fall.<br>
			Unlike in San Francisco, though, the surrounding areas are reliably sunny in summer—it gets hotter as you head inland.<br/>
			Even the rainy season has its charms, as hills that are golden the rest of the year turn a rich green and wildflowers become plentiful.<br>
			Precipitation is usually the heaviest between November and March.Berkeley is a university town, so the
			rhythm of the school year might affect your visit.<br/>
			It's easier to navigate the streets and find parking near the university between semesters, but there's also less buzz around town.

		<div>
		<span> Union Square.</span>
			BART is your friend here. You can catch the Millbrae train and exit at Powell Street.
			You can check out the stores in the Westfield Mall and then head over to the main square (Union Square),
			which may be out of your shopping budget with Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue and whatnot.
			But the roof of Macy’s is a pretty photo op and the square in general is a great tourist spot year-round.
			We’ve even witnessed a wedding here!
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<span>Golden Gate Bridge and Park:</span>
			Isn’t this the quintessential photo spot on every  Bay Area vacationer’s checklist?
			You’ve seen that bridge in the distance so many times when you’re walking around campus,
			and you should check it out up close if you haven’t already. The cheapest way to get here is by BART, 
			then take the Muni. Or if you’ve got a bigger budget, you could rent a car, drive over the bridge and then park,
			although you will have to brave Bay Area traffic.
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<span>Angel Island:</span>
			In the mood for a ferry ride, hiking, biking or camping, all with the prospect of a panoramic view of the Bay Area
			from Richmond to San Francisco? Good, because unless you have a friend with a private boat (so many students at a
			public university have that kind of connection, right?) that’s what you’re in for. The simplest way we can explain how
			to get to the island is this: drive to Tiburon and board the ferry to the island that way. It’s definitely a journey,
			but we guarantee it’s worth it.
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<span>Napa:</span>
			If you’re over 21, why not go wine tasting? Your time at Berkeley may be the only time that you’re so close to the
			world-renowned Northern California Wine Country. Bay Area public transportation won’t get you there, but if you own or
			rent a car, we definitely recommend checking out Napa.
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<span>Sacramento:</span>
			We know this isn’t part of the Bay Area, but it’s close enough that you could still take a trip here for the day.
			If you’re not a native to Nor Cal or California in general, you may not have explored the capital city. While we
			imagine many California schoolchildren have visited the Capitol Building at some point, now you can check out that
			piece of history without your second-grade teacher breathing down your back. Old Sacramento is pretty fun too,
			especially for history buffs. There are many museums like the California State Railroad Museum and the general
			Sacramento History Museum. Sacramento even has its own Tower Bridge, which may not be as famous as the Golden Gate,
			but we think it’s comparably picturesque, especially at night.
